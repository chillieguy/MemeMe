# MemeMe
## By Chuck Underwood

MemeMe is project number two of the Udacity iOS Nanaodegree.  Completing this project allowed me to get experience in the following areas:

* UIImagePicker
* UIImageView
* Completion Handlers
* Using Delegates - UIImagePickerDelegate & UIImagePickerDataSource
* NSAttributedString
* UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext to create an image from the screen
* Moving the keyboard to avoid hiding UITextFields and UILabels while editing
* UITextFieldDelegate
